Mailing in eLearning
====================

Now that you've completed the creation of your eLearning course, it's time to let your
participants know about it. And what better way to do that then via mass mailing?

In order to do this, you'll need to activate the *Mailing* setting. You will also need to install
the Odoo *Email Marketing* application for this feature to work.

Once activated, the user will then see a *Mail Attendees* smart button on every course template
page.

When clicked, the user is taken to a mass mailing template, where they can fully customize and
design a message to send to all participants of this course. Odoo provides a number of
professional-grade templates to choose from.

Then, the user can either *Send*, *Schedule*, or *Test* their mass mailing message.
